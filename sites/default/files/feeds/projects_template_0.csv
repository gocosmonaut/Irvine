Nevertheless, we delivered the classrooms, dining hall, kitchen, music room and administrative offices in time for fall classes and within the owner's budget."""15,Seattle Country Day School,,,"A 25,000 sf middle school facility expansion of an existing private grade school.",Seattle,Washington,Seattle,Education and Libraries,,Seattle Country Day School,Carlson Architects,,,,,,,,1,"The 25,000 sf expansion of this private grade school located on Queen Anne Hill added complete middle school facilities, including 11 dedicated classrooms over four floors with rooms equipped for science labs, technology, music, art and a multipurpose area.

Because of the building's unique shape and details, we used BIM to create a virtual 3-D model of the complex structural steel design of the building -  our ability to 'walk through' the building during the shop drawing process helped us avoid potentially costly obstacles.  Additionally, the building's 30-foot high concrete walls were placed in one continuous pour using self-consolidating concrete, making it the tallest pour of this type in the nation at the time."18,Buffalo Wild Wings,,,A vibrant restaurant tucked into the ground floor of an existing parking structure in downtown Portland.,Multiple Locations,,Portland,Food Service,,"MBH Enterprises, LLC","Bruce M. Carlson, CMA",,,,,,,,1,"One of our first restaurants for Buffalo Wild Wings was constructed in the heart of downtown Portland on the first floor of an existing parking structure. Post-tensioned concrete structures above and awkward utility tie-ins below made the project most challenging. On the interior of the building, custom millwork throughout and more than 70 large-screen televisions differentiate Buffalo Wild Wings from other restaurants. Our success in Portland led to more negotiated projects with this client in Oregon and California."19,McCormick and Schmick's Grill,,,This restaurant features a domed ceiling and stained-glass murals of the Columbia River Gorge.,Tualatin,Oregon,Portland,Food Service,,McCormick & Schmick Mgmt. Group,"Boora Architects, Inc.",,,,,,,,10,"Located in the very busy Bridgeport Village shopping center, this beautiful restaurant features a breathtaking stained-glass mural of scenes from the Columbia River Gorge set in the dome-shaped ceiling above the main dining area.

Built in three phases between 1909 and 1930, it has undergone multiple renovations with limited documentation, so every day brought new surprises. Extensive seismic upgrades involved over 1.8M pounds of steel and rebar -  compressing ten floors into six led us to recycle over 8,000 tons of wood, sheetrock, concrete and steel. By closing the store midway into construction we were able to accelerate construction and open the store two months ahead of schedule."25,The Benson Hotel Lobby and Bar Renovation,,,Meticulous renovation of the lobby restaurant and lounge in Portland's beautiful Benson Hotel.,Portland,Oregon,Portland,Historical Renovations,,Benson Hotel Limited Partnership,Karol Niemi Associates,,,,,,,,2,"The total transformation of this historic Portland landmark was completed in just four weeks while the hotel remained open to guests.

We stayed within budget and were treated fairly when the scope changed.,Barry R. Smith,Architect,PC Architect,4,"Renovation of this grand hotel, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, involved work on six floors and the lobby of the hotel, as well as restoration of the ballroom in the adjacent Princeton Building.

Battersby,Owner,Posh Ventures LLC,4,"In an amazing structural and architectural evolution, a Days Inn was transformed into a sleek, stylish, modern, urban hotel. Every part of the building was modified: all 174 guest rooms, the lobby, courtyard and garden. Additionally, the entire project was completed during a typical cold, wet northwest winter so the hotel would be ready in time for the annual Rose Festival celebration - just six months from start to finish. By shrink-wrapping and heating the entire building we were able to complete the exterior and interior work at the same time. The result was an award winning building that was finished on schedule and within the budget."29,RiverPlace Hotel,,,This five-star hotel underwent a fast-track renovation while remaining open for business.,Portland,Oregon,Portland,Hospitality,,Larkspur Hotels,"GGLO, LLC",,,,,,,,7,"This five-star hotel underwent a complete interior renovation in a fast-paced 13 weeks while the hotel remained open for business.

Deacon displays a level of integrity I have not experienced in the construction industry before.,Chris Scotthanson,Owner's Representative,Cohousing Resources,2,"Located in a heavily forested and steeply sloped area, this building consists of three floors of condos built above underground parking. Before beginning the project, we worked closely with the homeowners and developer to identify enough cost saving ideas to bring expenses in line with their budget constraints. Adding to the challenge of an already difficult site was the requirement to maintain access to the ""common house"" throughout the project, despite there being only single road access to the site. Finally, we provided all 28 homeowners the opportunity to select their own custom finishes."35,Newell Overlook Apartments,,,This 16 building apartment complex provides 125 units of low income housing for the community.,Oregon City,Oregon,Portland,Multi-Family Housing,,Newell Creek Limited Partnership,Raymond J.

Romero,Director of Construction,Charter Oak Partners,4,"The addition of this 280,000 sf precast concrete parking structure was the first phase of a project which then added 123,000 sf of retail space to what was previously called the Lincoln City Factory Stores. Very poor soil conditions added to the challenge of the fast-track project, which was completed while the retail stores in this 180,000 sf shopping center remained open for business."39,A Street Station,,,Underground parking structure alongside a busy urban street corner.,Lake Oswego,Oregon,Portland,Parking,,Gramor Development,Sienna Architects,,,,,,,,5,"Building a parking structure beside a busy city sidewalk and street in downtown Lake Oswego made this project a particular challenge.

Finally, we built the 12,000 sf underground barrel aging building which utilized cast-in-place concrete walls and a core plank concrete roof."43,Quimby Townhomes,,,Restoration of the building envelope of a three-story Pearl District condominium complex.,Portland,Oregon,Portland,Repair and Restoration,,Quimby Townhomes Condo.

This two-story project contains 280,000 sf of shopping space, a children's play area and a 250-seat restaurant. This location, near the airport and in an ancient riverbed, created the additional challenges of coordinating with the FAA and soil conditions requiring deep piles and an extensive array of grade beams.

The 150-foot clear-span roof structures in the basketball arena and pool utilize a glue-lam compression ring support system.Constructing much of the project through the cold and wet Idaho winter made the work more challenging.

First was a 14-screen theater inside a vacant space at Capitol Mall in Olympia. Before construction began, we learned that the space would be turned over to us without the underground utilities and slab on grade in place. Despite having to add this work to the schedule, we completed the project in only 80 days - in time for their grand opening. In Federal Way, we built a 16-screen complex which provides a cutting edge audio and visual experience for movie-goers.

Many of the windows and decks had been improperly installed during original construction, leading to widespread damage to the underlying support structures. RemcoDeacon repaired damaged areas, installed two layers of Weather Resistant Barrier and replaced old wood trim with new materials. Additionally, we installed new flashing at all surface transitions, including roof/wall and deck/wall interfaces."203,Fountain Court Condominiums,,,Meticulous record-keeping kept this HOA in the communication loop as construction progressed.,Kirkland,Washington,Seattle,Repair and Restoration,,Fountain Court Condominiums HOA,Building Envelope Tech. & Research,,,,,,,,10,"It became clear early on that there would be unexpected framing damage that would require structural work and shoring beyond the levels projected in the original scope on this five unit condominium repair in the heart of Kirkland. By project's end, our team had removed and replaced more than 20,000 sf of Hardi-plank siding and installed a complete a rain screen system as well as new windows through and a Pacific Polymers membrane coating system on the decks before repainting the entire building.

Mid-way through the project, the owner requested that we also enclose an open tournament deck -  this involved installing gyp-crete over the existing plywood sub-floor, all electrical, mechanical and sprinkler systems, a floating ACT ceiling cloud system and the standard interior finishes including a stone-veneer framed fireplace.

Because the decks are located directly above the parking garages continuously in use by Redmill residents, we were not able to completely block off the area. Additionally, we had to take extra precautions during the painting stage of the project to ensure that there was no overspray or paint spatter onto the cars parked in the driveway underneath the decks."208,Sammamish Hills Condominiums,,,Water damage repair to a 12-unit condominium complex.,Issaquah,Washington,Seattle,Repair and Restoration,,Sammamish Hills HOA,Soltner Group Architects,,,,,,,,9,"Tucked into the base of the hillside along the busy I-90 corridor, this 12-building condominium complex was severely impacted by water seeping into the building&rsquo - s envelopes as well as the exterior breezeways and stairways, all of which required repairs.

Extensive water damage caused more than a quarter of a million dollars worth of damage to the buildings' framing and sheathing and necessitated replacement of over 135,000 sf of vinyl siding with a combination of vinyl siding and masonry and a fresh coat of paint. Additionally, temporary access pathways to each of the 126 individual homeowner's units had to be provided while 20,000 sf of decks and walkways received new membrane coatings to prevent future damage."210,Twelve Central Square,,,Unprecedented damage and building defects quadruple the schedule of this massive repair project.,Bellevue,Washington,Seattle,Repair and Restoration,,"Twelve Central Square, LLC",Olympic Associates,,,,,,,,9,"This is a 10-building stucco-clad apartment complex with 26,000 sf of connecting courtyards built atop a steel-reinforced slab above a below-grade parking area. We initially contracted to replace the courtyard topping and membranes and tie them into approximately 4,000 sf of stucco at the wall bases. However, initial repairs not only uncovered severely damaged framing and sheathing but potentially dangerous construction defects, including large voids in the concrete slab, mis-aligned sill plates and incomplete or missing anchor bolts. Chasing and repairing the damaged components resulted in replacing 40,000 sf of stucco and 125 windows, 800 anchor bolts and completely resloping the structural slab to prevent future damage."211,Private Residence,,,to come,Seattle,Washington,Seattle,Repair and Restoration,,Resident,Silk Stuart Architects,,,,,,,,9,to come212,Waterford Place Apartments,,,Extensive unanticipated damages couldn't keep our team from completing the project on time.,Everett,Washington,Seattle,Repair and Restoration,,Black Rock Realty,Olympic Associates,,Marx Okubo Associates,Owner's Rep.,,,,,10,"Repairs to this 16 building apartment complex consisted of complete demolition of the concrete deck topping, sheathing, and re-sloping of all decks to allow for proper water drainage.

This landmark building was constructed in 1968 by Farmers Insurance Group and over time has become something of an icon. The five-story cast-in-place concrete structure was a cutting edge design in its time and has about 100,000 sf of space. With great visibility, the building overlooks the highest traveled intersection in the state (250,000 vehicles per day).A unique challenge of the acquisition was the schedule imposed by Farmer's Insurance. We began negotiations in October 2008 and the purchase was completed thirty days later. Even though acquiring this property during a deep recession made leasing and financing extremely challenging, our team was able to respond to a market opportunity to add a landmark building to the portfolio."214,S.D. Deacon Office Building,,,,Portland,Oregon,Portland,Office,,Owner,Architect,,,,,,,,10,"We bought this 30-year-old building, previously owned by Copeland Lumber, and redeveloped it into a multi-tenant office building for ourselves and other tenants.

Started just before the housing downturn in 2007, selling lots during the housing crisis that hit central Oregon especially hard was a challenge. While our initial plan was to develop and sell lots, we moved to Plan B and built homes in order to help move the properties. This approach helped with sales and provided us with experience in the single-family home market. We worked closely with the community to develop a plan that was compatible with the existing neighborhood. As always, our goal was to find a solution that was appealing to both the residents of the subdivision, as well as the neighbors."216,North Albany Village,,,"A mixed-use, village-style shopping center anchored by Ray's Food Place, The Corvallis Clinic and Starbucks.",Albany,Oregon,Portland,Mixed-Use,,Owner,Architect,,,,,,,,10,"North Albany Village is a village-style shopping center anchored by Ray's Food Place, The Corvallis Clinic and Starbucks.

By working with the majority who were in favor of the development and the city, we were ultimately able to achieve unanimous plan approval by the City Council, part of which required the mitigation of eight acres of wetlands, achieved through the purchase of local property and development of a new wetland."219,520 Building,,,This building has maintained high occupancy while undergoing tenant and structural upgrades.,Bellevue,Washington,Portland,Office,,Owner,Architect,,,,,,,,10,"In 2003 we purchased the building housing our Seattle office.

Because the complex lies on an island, access to the project for manpower and materials was limited to ferry or plane transportation. This means the normal process of coordinating the construction schedule was complicated by additional amounts of pre-planning to ensure timely delivery of materials and personnel. In the end, the scope of work for this two-story 13-building repair included widespread structural upgrades to the garage and entry way columns, new paint, elastomeric deck coating and miscellaneous interior repairs."222,Harbour House,,,Curved turrets made window replacement on the 'Juliet' balconies a special challenge.,Seattle,Washington,Seattle,Repair and Restoration,,Harbour House at Leschi HOA,Olympic Associates,,CDC Management,Owner's Rep.,,,,,10,"The exterior repair of this two-building condominium complex located in Seattle's Leschi neighborhood on Lake Washington was quite challenging.

The project was broken down into three phases and at one point the entire building was under full containment and scaffold. A majority of the work was self-performed by our highly skilled personnel and careful coordination with the homeowners was necessary to ensure all the interior repairs were completed in a timely and satisfactory manner."224,Lakeside West,,,The design process combined the Owner's proposal and RemcoDeacon's construction expertise.,Seattle,Washington,Seattle,Repair and Restoration,,Lakeside West HOA,Graham Baba Architects,,,,,,,,10,"Setting up seven floors of scaffolding is a snap, unless the building juts out over the water. The scope of this project consisted of a railing system remodel, partition repair and exterior paint for the entire building - half of which is balanced on pilings above the surface of Lake Washington.  In order to access the western elevation of the building, we extended heavy beams from the lower level parking area and used them to create a base for scaffolding. Even so, some of the work had to be conducted from the deck of a barge floating on the lake. The design-built rail system required care to choose materials that would hold up to waterfront exposure and successfully attach to the existing posts."225,Riverfront Landing,,,Extreme water damage began at the roof a continued down through the entire complex.,Bothell,Washington,Seattle,Repair and Restoration,,Riverfront Landing B&C Condo HOA,"J2 Building Consultants, Inc.",,,,,,,,10,"Riverfront Landing is a 45-unit, three-building waterfront complex situated along the Sammamish slough in Bothell.

This challenging project required multiple teams, and the small lot left little room for parking or storage, so delivery of everything - equipment, materials and manpower - had to be staged at offsite locations. Unusually wet weather resulted in delays, economic difficulties forced the replacement of several of our subs and electrical limitations required use of additional generators to power the heavier equipment.
